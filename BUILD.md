# LLAMARA Frontend - Build

To build the frontend, you need to have NodeJS according to the version specified in the [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) file installed.

Run the following commands to build the frontend:

```shell
npm run build
```

The build will be placed in the `dist` directory.

You normally don't need to build the frontend manually, as the CI/CD pipeline will do this for you.
